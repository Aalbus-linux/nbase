                             INSTALLATION

*) You need mk-configure.

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/mk-configure/
   https://github.com/cheusov/mk-configure

*) On such systems as Solaris-10 and -11 you may need libfts library
   (https://github.com/pullmoll/musl-fts). This allows you to build
   programs that use fts(3) functions. After installation modify
   CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS according, e.g.

   export CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/local/include'
   export LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib -lfts'

*) cd nbase-X-Y-Z-N

*) Set build variables, for example, PREFIX.
   export PREFIX=/usr/local/nbase LINKSPREFIX=/usr/local
   export COPTS='-g'
   export CC='cc -xc99 -m32'
   export CPPFLAGS='-I/opt/csw/lib'
   export LDFLAGS='-L/opt/csw/lib -Wl,-rpath,/opt/csw/lib -lfts'

*) Build utilities you need
   mkcmake ls grep find
   mkcmake all

*) mkcmake install

*) nbase project contains a lot of subprojects: cat, cut, etc.
   By default all subprojects are built and installed. You can build and
   install any subprojects you like.

   mkcmake all-cut all-cat install-cut install-cut

*)
There is a lot of Makefile variables that can be changed during
build and installation.

  Uniq for nbase:
  CURSES_LIBNAME - name of curses library, e.g., ncurses, curses, pdcurses etc.
                   The default it is "curses".

  Common for mk-configure:
  PREFIX         - where programs are installed to
  LINKSPREFIX    - where nb-NNN symlinks are installed to
  MANDIR         - root directory for manual pages
  DESTDIR        - fake root for installation (useful for packagers)
  CPPFLAGS
  CFLAGS
  LDFLAGS
  LDADD
  LEXLIB
  LEX
  YACC
  ...

------------------------------
Examples of build and installation:

 1)
     export PREFIX=/usr/nbase LINKSPREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc MANDIR=/usr/nbase/share/man
     mkcmake all
     env DESTDIR=/tmp/fake-root mkcmake install

 2)  env CC='icc' \
       PREFIX=/usr/pkg \
       LEX=flex \
       LEXLIB=-lfl \
       YACC='bison -y' \
       CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/pkg/include' \
       LDFLAGS='-L/usr/pkg/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/pkg/lib' \
          mkcmake -s all-banner install-banner
